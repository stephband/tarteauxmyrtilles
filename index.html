<p>It should be said, right from that outset, that there is no such thing as the perfect tarte aux myrtilles. Certainly there are great tarte aux myrtilles that may inspire for a week, and there are run-of-the-mill tarte aux myrtilles, but the act of rating a slice tarte aux myrtilles on any kind of scale is to miss the point, because a truly great tarte aux myrtilles experience is much more than the culinary artistry employed to combine succulent blueberries with an almond-hinted base; it is also the product of the context in which it is savoured; your mood, the environment, the flirtatiousness of the server, and perhaps above all, the amount of effort you have expended to deserve it.</p>

<p>Look, if I had a Euro for every time I have heard some inexperienced skier say, ‘that wasn’t a red run, that was more like a blue’ I would be, well, a moderately less poor man. It may have felt like a blue to them this morning with the sun shining and a light dusting of fresh powder filling in the grooves left by the Ratrac on its 4am grooming, but come back tomorrow when today’s slush is frozen into solid lumps, the sky is a whiteout and the Ratrac driver couldn’t get up to cover the bare patches due to an excess of local vino, and it may feel more like a black.</p>

<p>If rating pistes accurately is difficult due to their environment, then so it is with tarte aux myrtilles. Therefore any ratings on this website should be taken with a pinch of salt. Not literally, obviously; the most that should accompany a slice of tarte aux myrtilles is a light whipping of Chantilly cream. That said, many are simply great without, and there are also times, at the end of a 15km piste where you have perfectly executed every turn, when a blast of cheapo scooshy cream can elevate an average tart to unforeseen bliss. Think on.</p>
